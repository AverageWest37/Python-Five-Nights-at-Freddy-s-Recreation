# Python-Five-Nights-at-Freddy-s-Recreation
This game was made for my Introduction to Python class in high school. This was my very first game I made from actual code from the ground up. Code is HORRIBLE, but its functional. Note: game speed runs based on FPS, and base speed was 75 FPS, so I'm pretty sure if you are not at 75 FPS the game will run faster or slower.

I thought Five Nights at Freddy's would be the perfect game as my first game, as it seemed doable with the logic and graphics. I remember messing around in the GUI in Codeskulptor, making balls bounce around and messing with arrays. Making games is some of the most rewarding, and frustrating experiences. Making this game cemented my love for computer science, as well as game development, as you can create whatever your brain can come up with, for fun! Looking back at this, I am very very shocked on how good it looks, when it's literally a lot polygons and circles past me somehow painstakingly manually created.
