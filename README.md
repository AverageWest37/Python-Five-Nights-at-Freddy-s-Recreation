# Python-Five-Nights-at-Freddy-s-Recreation
This game was made for my Introduction to Python class in high school. This was my very first game I made from actual code from the ground up. Code is HORRIBLE, but its functional. Note: game speed runs based on FPS, and base speed was 75 FPS, so I'm pretty sure if you are not at 75 FPS the game will run faster or slower.
